I (the project owner Hesham El-Helw) decided to start on this project for the following main targets:

1 - To get more experience implementing a complete standard from the scratch (although I'm working in this field and participated in implementation of bigger wireless communication standards but I didn't create the whole steps my self)

2- To spread the knowledge (that may I acquired through my work in the field) to any one that may want this sort of knowledge that's why I made this projected as open source. The main reason for that is to get rewarded from Allah (my God and the Muslims God) cause in Islam, when you bring benefit to anyone you are rewarded from Allah so please maximize your benefit form this project cause as much you get benefit from it as much I get reward from Allah :-)

3- To provide a very small present to my Home country mates that died to bring better life to the Egyptians in the Egyptian Revolution that's why I named this project egyrev (EGYptian REVolution) to make me always remember how these brave guys sacrificed by their souls to bring better life to me.
